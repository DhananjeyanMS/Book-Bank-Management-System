In the new millennium, the knowledge economy will prevail. Nations will compete on the strength of knowledge and information. The battle will be won by those whose minds are pliable and dexterous.
Our library system opens doors for our people to the world beyond and within. It gives our people full opportunity to learn, live purposeful lives and grow to their full potential, intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually.

We are dedicated towards the cultivation of the spirit of learning among INDIANS. At Book Bank, we know the business of learning. Every effort is geared towards creating a network of libraries which accesses rich sources of information and offers convenient, affordable and useful services.
